# TIC-TAC-TOE - Browser Based Game

This application allows user to play Tic-Tac-Toe against themself. The user will be able to starts as 'X', switch turn to 'O' and vice versa. Player who has three marks on horizontal, vertical or diagonal row will win the game.
I created this game for the first project at General Assembly Program.

## Planning Story
I created this project followed logic steps below:
- Basic set up in HTML and GitHub repository
- Authentication process for user
- Create New Game function
- Game UI Round 1
- Game UI Round 2
- Update Game
- Play Game Again
- View Total Games
- Final Touches

During my development process, I encountered some problems and I always solved them logically based on my preference steps:
- First of all, I made a detail to-do list to keep all the tasks on track.
- I started to write and illustrate the workflow and all the problems I am facing to verify where the bug occurs.
- After that, I will review my lessons in class, along with using Google to search and read about similar problems to solve my own problems.
